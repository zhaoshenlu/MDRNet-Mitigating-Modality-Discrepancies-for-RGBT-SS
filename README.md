# MDRNet+ ---PyTorch
This is the official PyTorch implementation of MDRNet+ (IEEE TNNLS 2023): [Mitigating Modality Discrepancies for RGB-T Semantic Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10008228)
## Introduction
MDRNet+ is an improved and expanded version of our CVPR 2021 paper ABMDRNet: Adaptive-weighted Bi-directional Modality Difference Reduction Network for RGB-T Semantic Segmentation. An earlier version of this article was presented in part at CVPR 2021, DOI: 10.1109/CVPR46437.2021.00266
